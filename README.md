# AntiCrash
Blocks the malicious exploit used by players in Tera with the intent to crash your game. 

When such an event occurs, you will be informed of it ingame (including the name of the player that did it) and a file named AntiCrash_logs.txt will be created in the top folder of Tera Toolbox, with more details about it.
